LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN LEARN IN ONE SUMMER

______________________________________________________________________
Conferences, Papers, and People

Advanced Robotics and Intelligent Systems:
  A conference in Taiwan that is hosted every 2 years (it appears).
  It seems that the contestants focus more on the physical systems
  than the programming, althought they're highly entangled.  It's
  harder to derrive sheer computer algorithms from the titles of the
  papers.

Computer and Robot Vision:
  A conference in Canada that seems promising for my purposes.  I've
  only looked at the winner from 2014 but I'm interested to go back.
  It seems like they have some good ones.  Nope, jk, no papers before
  2014. The 2013 website doesn't list the winners and the rest of the
  links in their archives don't exist anymore.  Oh well, cool idea.

Vincent Lepetit:
  A part time professor at EPFL and a long time worker with CVLab, he
  does work on augmented reality, but more recently he's been focused
  on finding fast descriptors for images, probably because of the
  large role key point tracking has in adding virtual elements to
  reality.

Terms and Definitions

Affine transformation:
  A transormation that retains the point, line, and planar qualities
  of the geometry on which it is inflicted, examples include scaling,
  translating, reflecting, rotating.

Aliasing:
  An effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable
  when sampled. (When signals merge with each other)

Band-pass filter:
  This is a window function for frequency filtering.  It passes
  frequencies within a desired range and fails all others.

Convolution (Computer Science):
  In computer science, wikipedia says this is the process of mapping a
  sequence of tuples to a tuple of squences.  In example
  (a1,a2,a3) (b1,b2,b3) (c1,c2,c3) -> (a1,b1,c1) (a2,b2,c2) (a3,b3,c3)

Convolution (Mathematics):
  Combines two fucntions f(x) and g(x) to produce a third function
  h(x) whose values are given by the area of overlap (of f and g) as a
  function of the amount one function (either f or g) is translated.

Corner Strength:
  Measured by looking at the smallest of all SSD for a given patch in
  the Moravec corner detection algorithm. If this SMALLEST SSD is of
  a large value then that patch is considered a point of
  interest. Rewording the above, if all SSD's surrounding a pixel are
  large then it is a point of interest.

Delaunay Triangulation:
  The triangulation of a set of points such that no single point is
  inside the circumference of the triangle that form that set of
  points. Under the assumption that the set being analyzed is already
  triangulated.

Difference of Gaussians:
  Applying different Gaussian filters to an image and subtracting the
  images from each other.  In greyscale this will highlight all sharp
  changes in pixel intensity (or edges) in an image.

Fourier Transform:
  The mathematical transformation of a signal between the time and
  frequency domains. Its foundation lies on the fact that any
  periodic function can be written as the sum of simple sin and cos
  waves. The fourier transform in essence can be used to extract the
  mathematical components of a very complicated wave form. Once
  individual components are extracted, each one can represent some
  different data set. This is used in image analysis across rows and
  columns, but I am not sure why that is / can be valuable data.

Fuzzy Inference System:
  From my current understanding (finding the original research paper
  and reading the introduction) this is system of statistical
  correlation and (inter/extra)polation with a data set.  It is the
  process of understanding that as an observer of the physical world,
  the clutter can be thought of as a hidden markov chain.

Gaussian Filter:
  A filter whose impulse response is a guassian function. An advantage
  of using this is that it does a better job of grouping neighbors
  than a step function.

Gaussian Function:
  Defined by f(x) = a*exp( -(x-b)^2 / 2c^2 ) + d.  This is what is
  used in statistics as a normal distribution and produces a 'bell
  curve'.  Where: a is the height of the peak, b is the position of
  the center of the peak, c (the standard deviation) controls the
  width of the bell curve, and d is the value that the function
  approaches for from the peak (often set to 0).

Group Delay:
  When signals are sent from one location to another (through air /
  wires / etc.) each frequency signal is delayed by a different
  amount, 'group delay' is the measure of time delay for the amplitude
  envelopes of each component of a signal.

Haar-like Features:
  Are used to refer to features made up by adjacent rectangular
  regions of a detection window in an image. An example would be using
  a face, the eyes are usually rectangular regions above the cheeks
  and of lower average pixel values (darker).

Haar Wavelet:
  A sequence of rigid edged functions that form a basis or family of
  wavelets. This wavelet is constructed of the fewest possible
  unit length vectors (simplest) and it is not continuous. Wavelet
  analysis is very similar to Fourier analysis (just to make a
  connection)

Hann Function:
  A discrete window function that provides a linear combination of
  modulated rectangular windows. Window function is defined below.
  This also relates to Fourier transforms.

Harris & Stephens Corner detection:
  An improved upon Moravec corner detection that takes in account the
  directional flow of regions of pixels.  A corner is valid if there
  is a large variation in patches in all directions (Rather than the
  average or a single direction).

Hessian Matrix:
  A square matrix of the second order partial derrivatives of a
  function.

Hough Transform:
  Creating a linear represenation (approximate) of a set of points.

Integral Image (Summed Area Table):
  A data structure and algorithm used to generate the sum of values in
  a rectangular subset grid.

Isotropic:
  Being uniform in all orientations, such as a sphere.

Largest Passage Algorithm:   NO RESEARCH PAPER FOUND
  No papers found.  I will assume that it scans the space in the path
  of travel with consecutive circles of increasing radius and finds
  the direction (angle) with the lowest circumference-collision
  frequency.

Lucas Kanade method:
  A widely used differential method for estimating optical flow. It
  assumes that the flow in the neighborhood of a pixel is constant. 
  This method also utilizes many neighboring pixels at once and
  therefore cannot be used to focus on the interior of uniform
  regions of an image.

Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System:

Mamdani Fuzzy Inference System (trained offline with 
      Neuro Fuzzy Function approximation):

Markov Property:
  When the conditional probability distribution of future conditions
  only depends on the present state, not on the events proceeding to
  it. (Each state only depends on one state prior)

Markov Models:
  System state: ___Fully Observable___________Partially Observable___
   Autonomous  |    Markov Chain          |    Hidden Markov Chain   |
   Controlled  | Markov Decision Process  |         PO MDP           |
               |__________________________|__________________________|

Matrix Norm:
  A matrix that is normal in the orthogonal sense.

Moravec corner detection algorithm:
  Generates overlapping patches of pixels across an image and then
  compares the patches to all their overlapping neighbors for
  similarity. The similarity between two patches is measured by the
  sum of Squared Differences, with a lower number indicating more
  similarity. The flaw with this algorithm is that it incorrectly
  marks standalone varying patches as interest points. It would be
  more accurate to ensure that there are multiple other interest
  points surrounding.

Optical Flow:
  Pattern of apparent motion of objects, or pixels in the case of
  computer vision.

Orthonormality:
  Two vectors are said to be 'orthonormal' when they are orthogonal
  (at right angles) to each other and also of unit length (normalized)

Point Cloud Based Autonomous Navigation:

Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 1999:
  Used to detect and describe local features in images.

Sensor Data Fusion based Algorithm:  

Sobel Operator:
  Sometimes called the Sobel Filter, generates an image that
  emphasizes edges and transitions. It is typically an operator that
  finds the difference between groups of pixels in rows and
  columns. It is relatively inexpensive but the gradient approximation
  is relatively crude, especially for high variance images. This can
  also be thought of as a pixel-wise derrivative on the chosen axis.
  A downside to this algorithm is that is only usually done on the x
  or the y axis, loosing diagonals.

Speeded up Robust Features (SURF) 2006:
  A local feature detector that is faster than SIFT and based on 2D
  HAAR wavelet responses and makes efficient use of integral images.

Structure Tensor:
  Also referred to as the second-moment matrix, it is a matrix derived
  from the gradient of a function. Very similar to a slope field, it
  demonstrates the predominant directions of a gradient in a specific
  neighborhood to a point, but it is also used to measure the degree
  of coherence of these vectors. If they are all similar in an area,
  there were be a higher degree of coherence.

Sum of Squared Difference (SSD):
  This one's self explanatory. Cumulative sum of squared pixel-wise
  differences over an area. (p1-p2)^2 + ... + (pn-1 - n)^2 

Window Function:
  In signal processing, this is a function whose value is 0 outside of
  some chosen interval. If the value is constant inside the window
  then it is considered a rectangular window function. This is used
  to find overlap between multiple functions, or a "view through the
  window".
