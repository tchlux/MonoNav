How to move forward: Clear your thoughts.

I feel like edge detection is more useful for shape recognition and
keypoint detection is more useful for general purpose object
recognition.  What I'm getting at is that keypoint detection is only
valuable if you have a database to cross check all your images with
and the camera is trained.  I suppose that is the best way to go for
general purpose recognition but I feel like you can creat a functional
navigation system that is simple and doesn't require a database if you
just identify the boundaries and velocities of objects in your viewing
frame.  The question is, can I find an algorithm that has already been
made that can create bounding shapes for objects in a video feed.  If
it can identify the shape of objects through images successfully then
it can classify regions of the image as moving.  It would need to keep
an active record of the shapes it has seen in the last frames.  The
key is edge detection.  

Question: Why is keypoint detection so useful? The field has found a
ton of uses for it?

Project: Look for the best way to create the bounding volume of a
shape in an image. Are trapeziods the best things to use? I'd say that
is the most general case, triangles would work well too, just limit to
a minimum size.
