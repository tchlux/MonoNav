NOTE:
  The above two are function declarations. You do not need to include
  the parameter names in the function declarations -- just the types
  of the parameters in the correct order is adequate. So, the above
  two declarations could also have been written as

int getNum (char *);

int getMin (int, int);

In general, though, it is useful to include the parameter names so
that you can refer to them in the pre and post conditions.
