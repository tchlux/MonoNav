$./huffman -e story
$./huffman -d story

This should test the general coding schematic.  3 leaves, 2
internal nodes, encryption schemes of different lengths, this covers
most of the bases.


$./huffman -e test1
$./huffman -d test1

This specifically tests a tree that is given many letters with the
same occurance as the ones before.


$./huffman -e test2
$./huffman -d test2

This will target the necesity to sort the list of letters and
occurances, letters with higher occurances come first.

$./huffman test2

testing a missing flag

$./huffman -a test2

testing an incorrect flag

$./huffman -e test3

testing on a file that does not have a .txt

$./huffman -d test3

testing on a file that does not have a .puff
