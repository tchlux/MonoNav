Program: Graph Colouring

Purpose:

This program will find valid coloring schemes for sets of vertices in
a graph that are considered to be connected within a range of thresh
and with color difference limitations specified by the delta vector.

Usage:  Run the following commands-
	$make
	$./colour points.txt delta.txt

points.txt can be any file with syntax being:
x1 y1
x2 y2
...
xn yn

With single spaces between the coordinates, line length limit of 10
digits, and no repeated vertices.



delta.txt can be any file with syntax being:
thresh
d1 d2 d3 ... dn

Where thres is a positive integer value for the threshold of
connectivity and d1, d2, ..., d3 are single space seperated positive
integer delta vector values.
