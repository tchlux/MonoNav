numbers:  A program for fining shared prime factors
Author: Thomas Lux

Compiling:
	--go to the directory containing all of the program files
	  (naturalPrime.cc, helper.cc, helper.h)

	--Then run these commands from the command line in a terminal
		as given in an example below

			person@computer:filepath/$ g++ -c naturalPrime.cc helper.cc
			person@computer:filepath/$ g++ naturalPrime.o helper.o -o numbers

	--Now you've created an executable called numbers

Running:
	--You can run the newly created executable by typing 

	  person@computer:filepath/$ ./numbers ARGUMENTS

	-- where valid arguments are natural numbers
	   that are space separated

	Expected output includes:
	-- the prime factors of each number given
	-- one final listing of the prime factors shared by every
	   number given. 
	-- an Error message if no valid arguments are given
	-- No prime factors for 0's and 1's
	-- shared prime factors means the shared prime factors of all
	   numbers given, if one number is given, it's prime factors
	   are considered to be shared and therefore will be listed
