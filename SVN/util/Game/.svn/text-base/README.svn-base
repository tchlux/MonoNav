To test the collision you can do:

$ make Blocks

-> This should compile about 9 or so things with the 03 flag, which
   will take about 10 - 20 seconds

and then do:

$ ./Blocks

-> Now that you did that for fun, (it's kind of broken but they're
   more-so 'features'

To actually see collision (without ejection) do:

$ make test
... (Compile ~2 more things)
$ ./test testVN.obj

-> This will run test giving it the obj for a cube with 6 different
   colored faces and normals.  The other test objects (testV.obj,
   testVT.obj, testVTN.obj) do not work right now since the shader
   stuff is broken.
-> You can control one of the blocks with the arrow keys, you can
   twist the block by holdin "Space" and usin the arrow keys.
-> If you want to see the ejection code working, go into "test.cc" and
   change line 118 and make it read:

      if (Clone::Collides(test, test1, true))
                                       ^^^^ With this flipped to true

     Location of Code        
==========================   

-> Box-box Collision is in Clone.cc under the function "Clone::Collides"

-> Animation has not been written, I will do it or something like it
   over the end of exam week and summer though if you care to see it
   later
