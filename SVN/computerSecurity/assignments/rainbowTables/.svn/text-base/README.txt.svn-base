DESCRIPTION:  type:
	       $ make
	       $ ./build_rainbow FILENAME.txt

	       When you run this program with a dictionary of words,
	       it builds the corresponding rainbow table with starting
	       and ending passwords.  It's really good at being
	       random!  Good luck.

WARRANTY: Buy a hammer, if it doesn't work, smash your computer.
