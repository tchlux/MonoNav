INFO FOR USERS:

There are a few fun ways to use this program.  One of them, is to
simply print it out and burn it right there on the spot.  Once your
satisfied with how much time you've wasted, go ahead and try to run it
on a computer.  The final compiled program can simply be executed.  If
you would like to give a specific string to be encrypted; you can
simply enter at the appropriate prompt as well as a 10 bit key of 0's
and 1's.  Now, if you want to do things with files you need to plan
ahead.  When you execute the program, enter in some command line
arguments, the first one is an input file, the second is an output
file and the third can be the 10 bit key of zero's and ones.  If the
output file is ommitted, the 10 bit key cannot be given.  Have fun!
