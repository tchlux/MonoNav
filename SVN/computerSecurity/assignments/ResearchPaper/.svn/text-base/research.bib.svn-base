  year={2010},
  note={Opens with a mention of how few articles there are on cell
                  phone security, didn't realize that's such a sparse
                  topic.  There is one paper that's mentioned in the
                  citations as being really well collected.  They also
                  say that the topics mentioned in that paper are only
                  a subset of the topics in this one.  We'll see.},

  note={This paper seems to be more focused on the actual legal side
                  of cell phone tracking.  Not as relevant to this
                  project, but has some interesting information about
                  what a cellphone can do that could be useful.},

  note={This person is very .. skeptical.  Much of this paper seems
                  distorted and non-scientific, but regardless there
                  are some valuable ideas that can be taken.  Much of
                  the information regarding the functionality of cell
                  phones and some of the tech specs seem reliable},
