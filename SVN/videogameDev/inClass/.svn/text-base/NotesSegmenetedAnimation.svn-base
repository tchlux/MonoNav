	     How to rotate connected objects     
	=========================================

-> You would use a tree structure of connections, and the rotation
   startes at one base point

-> For example, the hip would be the root node of a person, any
   rotation that occurs on the y axis of the hip can be applied to the
   entire body of the figure

-> Usually, to represent a body that does not have gaps, there is some
   skeleton and then each triangle for rednering is mapped based off
   of some ratio of movement of the adjacent joints/members

-> New method of representing animation
---> Euler angles, axis angle (vector and theta for rotation)
-> Quaternions - Thought of in the 19th century as an extension to
                 complex numbers.  Can we take this to higher
                 dimensions? That would be introducing hyper complex
                 numbers

-> (a + bi + cj + dk) This is a quaternion, it is essentially another
   form of a vector

-> Euler Angles - we used three angles to interpolate between two
                  rotations 

-> We could just use a vector and a single rotation, or we could use a
   quaternion because it guarentees the straightest path between two
   points

-> Let's say that we have some 

axis	= [1, 0, 0]  = [x,y,z]
angle	= 90 degrees = 0
q	= [x*sin(0/2), y*sin(0/2), z*sin(0/2), cos(0/2)] 
           ^^ x value  ^^ y value  ^^ z value  ^^ scalar

And, we can go the other way
q	= [q1, q2, q3, q4]
axis	= [q1, q2, q3, q4] /|| [q1, q2, q3]
angle	= 2*arccos(q4)

Quaternion that represents a 180 degree rotation about the x-axis
axis	 = [1,0,0]
rotation = 180 degrees
q	 = [1*sin(180/2), 0*sin(180/2), 0*sin(180/2), cos(180/2)] 
         = [1,0,0,0]

rotation = -180 degrees
q2	 = [1*sin(-180/2), 0*sin(-180/2), 0*sin(-180/2), cos(-180/2)] 
         = [-1,0,0,0]

This matrix represents a quaternion q as a transormation matrix

q = [x,y,z,w]
