First to cover tansparancy from last class.
-> Create a new variable that is the alpha value for a pixel
-> Set this varibale to a value for each model (or clone)

-> When computing in the shader use glFrag_Color.a for alpha set for a
--- particular pixel
-> Turn on glBlend mode so that the alpha channel in the shader files
--- is used calculations


-> Billboards, load in a texture to a 2d surface

3x3 of rotation and scale   3x1 for translation
1x3 of 0's not used         1x1 for the value 1 (make 4x4 identity)

all of this makes up the 4x4 matrix that we use in the game

To make a billboard, just make the draw for that clone change the view
matrix so that the identity is that upper left 3x3 but leave the
translations that are the result of the view multiplication
