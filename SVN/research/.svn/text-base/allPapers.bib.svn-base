  note={ Problem :  Existing MAS algorithms must assume smoothness in
                  the data that is being analyzed. It is important to
                  maximize efficiency (least resources used) of multi
                  robot systems.

         Terms   :  MAS -----> Multi-robot Active Sensing
                    DEC-MAS -> Decentralized MAS
                    DPM-GP --> Dirichlet Process Mixture of Gaussian
                               processes
                    
         Purpose :  To introduce a new algorithm that outperforms old
                  equations for gathering data with MAS systems.  In
                  doing so, they maintain the important criteria are
                  that of [combining] the gathering and predicting of
                  data more efficiently and supporting efficient
                  decentralized coordination.

         Flaws   :  None that I found.  Possibly only that it is too
                  specific for me to truly ingrain myself in the
                  work. They could have tested on more than just two
                  sets of actively-changing data though.  I would
                  think that migration patterns, weather to an extent,
                  and even data flow over computer networks.

         Openings:  They mentioned none, possibly the optimization of
                  the algorithms they used to move the robots.  This
                  would appear to be more parameter tweaking than
                  actual research though.  Now, it does provide
                  interesting ideas about the use of multi-robot
                  systems to analyze sets of changing data.

        Terms   :  ABS -> Agent-based Decision Support system

        Purpose :  This paper is proposing a simulator to be used for
                  emergency preparedness in large venues such as
                  stadiums or auditoriums.  Their simulator's use of
                  Agent based systems proposes three primary
                  advantages: allows for highly complex dynamics, can
                  be done with little or no knowledge of global
                  inter-dependencies, and can be easily adjusted for
                  simulation of different scenarios.

        Flaws    :  None major. They seem to be cutting their scope
                  down a lot though.  Their simulator is unique
                  because of its agent-based system, but it only
                  provides the ability to simulate fires (given these
                  fires have varying intensities, spread rates, and
                  smoke volumes produced) and no other events.

        Openings :  Simulation of disaster events is currently an
                  "open and active research field, since there are
                  many disasters that have not yet been addressed."
                  given this I would say the opening is in added
                  functionality to this agent-based system, including
                  more disaster events and more detailed decision
                  making models for the agents.
