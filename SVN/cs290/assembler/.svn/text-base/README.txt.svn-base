Program: assemble

This program takes a .asm assembly file as an argument and creates the
hexadecimal output corresponding to the machine code for the program.

Usage:

$ assemble filename.asm

-> take note that this relies on the files opcodes.txt and
   registers.txt to check for valid syntax


CURREN STATUS:

Incomplete -

I'm working on the syntax checking of the assembly file.  

There is 0 functionality when it comes to writing the .obj file.  

It should compile, but this doesn't say much.  

I'll be working more tonight after I've finished my other hw for Mon.
