Make the simulator by typing 

$ make LC2200

Run the program with:

$ ./LC2200

This is a functioning LC2200 simulator that operates on a timeslicing
round robin scheduler and makes use of a Least Recently Used page
replacement policy.

Valid Command Sequences:

cpu			-- Displays all the registers of the cpu

displayPageTable        -- Displays the current page table for the machine, showing the
                        - information for each of the virtual pages, their associated physical
			- page and the number of words in the page that are utilized along with
			- the PID of the process that owns the page

fg [< pid >]		-- gives the most recently added program ownership of
			- I/O, optional argument for the PID to give I/O capabilities

jobs			--  Prints out the process ID, the name of the process (program)
			- and the status (running/waiting) for each process in the ready queue
			- and the process currently being executed on the processor. 

kill < pid >		-- Kills the given process regardless of completion

prog [&]		-- Name an assembled program file (name = prog) with an
			- optional ampersand for restricting the I/O capabilities of the program

queue			-- Print a list of PCB's in the ready and completed queue

restart			-- Allow the machine to run between user commands

step < num > [< pid >]	-- Allow the machine to take 'num' decode
			- sequences, optional argument for 'pid' to allow a specific program the
			- given number of steps, and I/O privaleges during these steps

suspend			-- Restrict the machine from running decode sequences between
			- user inputs, all commands are allowed during suspend
