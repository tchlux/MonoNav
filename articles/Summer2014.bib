  tracker description of the algorithm},

  volume={2},

  year={2001},
note={This article describes the process of generating the pixel flow
                  with the lucas kanade method using a pyramidical
                  scheme.  This way the optical flow of pixel regions
                  can be applied upwards thruogh the pyramid to reduce
                  the search region size and complexity class of the
                  problem.}

  note={Scale-Invariant feature transform SIFT:  I've read through the
                  first three pages and gotten a lot of good
                  information.  They summarize the four computational
                  steps of the process and that is about enough to
                  understand what is happening.  This paper is a good
                  read, and if I'm ever at a dead end for finding
                  knowledge it'd be good to come back to.  This paper
                  is an improvement upon the previous SIFT publication
                  by (Lowe 1999) so going back to that paper may be
                  helpful but since this is the improved algorithm it
                  might be a waste of time. }
