LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN LEARN IN ONE SUMMER

.mov to .avi Conversion Command:
  ffmpeg -i test.mov -sameq -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -acodec pcm_u8 test.avi

Corner Strength:
  Measured by looking at the smallest of all SSD for a given patch in
  the Moravec corner detection algorithm. If this SMALLEST SSD is of
  a large value then that patch is considered a point of
  interest. Rewording the above, if all SSD's surrounding a pixel are
  large then it is a point of interest.

Delaunay Triangulation:
  The triangulation of a set of points such that no single point is
  inside the circumference of the triangle that form that set of
  points. Under the assumption that the set being analyzed is already
  triangulated.

Fourier Transform:
  The mathematical transformation of a signal between the time and
  frequency domains. Its foundation lies on the fact that any
  periodic function can be written as the sum of simple sin and cos
  waves. The fourier transform in essence can be used to extract the
  mathematical components of a very complicated wave form. Once
  individual components are extracted, each one can represent some
  different data set, allowing for all modern day radio wave
  communications. This is used in image analysis across rows and
  columns, but I am not sure why that can be relevant.

Haar-like Features:
  Are used to refer to features made up by adjacent rectangular
  regions of a detection window in an image. An example would be using
  a face, the eyes are usually rectangular regions above the cheeks
  and of lower average pixel values (darker).

Haar Wavelet:
  A sequence of rigid edged functions that form a basis or family of
  wavelets. This wavelet is constructed of the fewest possible
  unit length vectors (simplest) and it is not continuous. Wavelet
  analysis is very similar to Fourier analysis (just to make a
  connection)

Hann Function:
  A discrete window function that provides a linear combination of
  modulated rectangular windows. Window function is defined below.
  This also relates to Fourier transforms.

Integral Image (Summed Area Table):
  A data structure and algorithm used 

Isotropic:
  Being uniform in all orientations, such as a sphere.

Lucas Kanade method:
  A widely used differential method for estimating optical flow. It
  assumes that the flow in the neighborhood of a pixel is constant. 
  This method also utilizes many neighboring pixels at once and
  therefore cannot be used to focus on the interior of uniform
  regions of an image.

Markov Property:
  When the conditional probability distribution of future conditions
  only depends on the present state, not on the events proceeding to
  it. (Each state only depends on one state prior)

Markov Models:
  System state: ---Fully Observable-----------Partially Observable---
   Autonomous  |    Markov Chain          |    Hidden Markov Chain   |
   Controlled  | Markov Decision Process  |         PO MDP           |
                -----------------------------------------------------

Moravec corner detection algorithm:
  Generates overlapping patches of pixels across an image and then
  compares the patches to all their overlapping neighbors for
  similarity. The similarity between two patches is measured by the
  sum of Squared Differences, with a lower number indicating more
  similarity. The flaw with this algorithm is that it incorrectly
  marks standalone varying patches as interest points. It would be
  more accurate to ensure that there are multiple other interest
  points surrounding.

Optical Flow:
  Pattern of apparent motion of objects, or pixels in the case of
  computer vision.

Orthonormality:
  Two vectors are said to be 'orthonormal' when they are orthogonal
  (at right angles) to each other and also of unit length (normalized)

Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) 1999:
  Used to detect and describe local features in images.

Sobel Operator:
  Sometimes called the Sobel Filter, generates an image that
  emphasizes edges and transitions. It is typically an operator that
  finds the difference between groups of pixels in rows and
  columns. It is relatively inexpensive but the gradient approximation
  is relatively crude, especially for high variance images. This can
  also be thought of as a pixel-wise derrivative on the chosen axis.
  A downside to this algorithm is that is only usually done on the x
  or the y axis, loosing diagonals.

Speeded up Robust Features (SURF) 2006:
  A local feature detector that is faster than SIFT and based on 2D
  HAAR wavelet responses and makes efficient use of integral images.

Structure Tensor:
  Also referred to as the second-moment matrix, it is a matrix derived
  from the gradient of a function. Very similar to a slope field, it
  demonstrates the predominant directions of a gradient in a specific
  neighborhood to a point, but it is also used to measure the degree
  of coherence of these vectors. If they are all similar in an area,
  there were be a higher degree of coherence.

Sum of Squared Difference (SSD):
  This one's self explanatory. Cumulative sum of squared pixel-wise
  differences over an area. (p1-p2)^2 + ... + (pn-1 - n)^2 

Window Function:
  In signal processing, this is a function whose value is 0 outside of
  some chosen interval. If the value is constant inside the window
  then it is considered a rectangular window function. This is used
  to find overlap between multiple functions, or a "view through the
  window".
