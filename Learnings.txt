LOOK AT ALL THE THINGS YOU CAN LEARN IN ONE SUMMER

.mov to .avi Conversion Command:
  ffmpeg -i test.mov -sameq -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -acodec pcm_u8 test.avi

Corner Strength:
  Measured by looking at the smallest of all SSD for a given patch in
  the Moravec corner detection algorithm.  If this SMALLEST SSD is of
  a large value then that patch is considered a point of interest.

Delaunay Triangulation:
  The triangulation of a set of points such that no single point is
  inside the circumference of the triangle that form that set of
  points.  Under the assumption that the set being analyzed is already
  triangulated.

Fourier Transform:
  The mathematical transformation of a signal between the time and
  frequency domains.  Its foundation lies on the fact that any
  periodic function can be written as the sum of simple sin and cos
  waves.  The fourier transform in essence can be used to extract the
  mathematical components of a very complicated wave form.  Once
  individual components are extracted, each one can represent some
  different data set, allowing for all modern day radio wave
  communications.

Hann Function:
  A discrete window function that provides a linear combination of
  modulated rectangular windows. Window function is defined below.

Isotropy:
  Being uniform in all orientations.

Lucas Kanade method:
  A widely used differential method for estimating optical flow.  It
  assumes that the flow in the neighborhood of a pixel is  constant. 
  This method also utilizes many neighboring pixels at onece and
  therefore cannot be used to focus on the interior of uniform
  regiions of an image.

Markov Property:
  When the conditional probability distribution of future conditions
  only depends on the present state, not on the events proceeding to
  it. (Each state only depends on one state prior)

Markov Models:
  System state: ---Fully Observable-----------Partially Observable---
   Autonomous  |    Markov Chain          |    Hidden Markov Chain   |
   Controlled  | Markov Decision Process  |         PO MDP           |
                -----------------------------------------------------

Moravec corner detection algorithm:
  Generates overlapping patches of pixels across an image and then
  compares the patches to all their overlapping neighbors for
  similarity. The similarity between two patches is measured by the
  sum of Squared Differences, with a lower numer indicating more
  similarity. The flaw with this algorithm is that it incorrectly
  marks standalone varying patches as interest points.  It would be
  more accurate to ensure that there are multiple other interest
  points surrounding.

Optical Flow:  
  Pattern of apparent motion of objects, or pixels in the case of
  computer vision.

Sobel Operator:
  Sometimes called the Sobel Filter, generates an image that
  emphasizes edges and transitions. It is typically an operator that
  finds the difference between groups of pixels in rows and
  columns. It is relatively inexpensive but the gradient approximation
  is relatively crude, especially for high variance images.

Structure Tensor:
  Also referred to as the second-moment matrix, it is a matrix derived
  from the gradient of a function.  Very similar to a slope field, it
  demonstrates the predominant directions of a gradient in a specific
  neighborhood to a point, but it is also used to measure the degree
  of coherence of these vectors.

Sum of Squared Difference (SSD):
    This one's self explanatory. Cumulative sum of squared pixel-wise
    differences over an area.   (p1-p2)^2 + ... + (pn-1 - n)^2 

Window Function:
  In signal processing, this is a function whose value is 0 outside of
  some chosen interval.  If the value is constant inside the window
  then it is considered a rectangular window function.  This is used
  to find overlap between multiple functions, or a "view through the
  window".
