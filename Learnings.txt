.mov to .avi Conversion Command:
  ffmpeg -i test.mov -sameq -vcoded msmpeg4v2 -acodec pcm_u8 test.avi

Lucas Kanade method:
  A widely used differential method for estimating optical flow.  It
  assumes that the flow in the neighborhood of a pixel is  constant. 
  This method also utilizes many neighboring pixels at onece and
  therefore cannot be used to focus on the interior of uniform
  regiions of an image.

Optical Flow:  
  Pattern of apparent motion of objects, or pixels in the case of
  computer vision.

Markov Property:
  When the conditional probability distribution of future conditions
  only depends on the present state, not on the events proceeding to
  it. (Each state only depends on one state prior)

Delaunay Triangulation:
  The triangulation of a set of points such that no single point is
  inside the circumference of the triangle that form that set of
  points.  Under the assumption that the set being analyzed is already
  triangulated.

Common Markov Models:
  System state: ---Fully Observable-----------Partially Observable---
   Autonomous  |    Markov Chain          |    Hidden Markov Chain   |
   Controlled  | Markov Decision Process  |         PO MDP           |
