Summer Research 2014

Week 1
-> set plan for entire summer
-> find out how to get pixel data from mp4
-> discover how many processes a smartphone can do in a set amount of
    time, to produce a target level number of computations
-> record a simple test video on phone and identify an object moving
    across the field of vision
-> think of title of project and find multiple research articles that
    may or may not directly relate to this type of processing

Week 2
-> find papers that relate to low power navigation, specifically the
    challenge that I want to focus on
-> look into more monographic SLAM to see how pose estimation works
    see if I can come up with a similar algorithm
-> read from openCV book on how to identify certain types of shapes in
    a viewing plane, start to think on how these shapes can be sorted
-> use openCV to identify a shape in a video and then to continue to
    identify that same shape through multiple frames as it moves
    across the screen
-> find/create a data structure that can effectively store relative
    locations of shapes
-> research into papers that talk about storing objects based off of
    relative locations rather than absolute locations (different types
    of map representation)

Week 3
-> re-evaluate my progress and plan for the summer
-> use openCV libraries to begin a pose estimation
-> attempt to identify as many objects as possible consistently from a
    circular walking video around them
-> examine the computational requirements to do this process and
    compare them to what will be available at real time
-> use the same function to identify multiple shapes in a new test
    video and then identify which of the shapes is most likely to be
    closest 

Week 4
-> find more papers that relate to pose estimation / monographic SLAM
    / robotic navigation / map storage
-> write a fully drafted introduction for final paper, put in a works
    cited page and make sure it's up to date
-> come up with the metrics that will be used to evaluate my data
    gathered
-> decide officially which conferences I will be sending the paper too
    and align my paper with the requirements that are posted for those
    conferences
-> re-evaluate the effectiveness of the data structures that I have
    implemented for storing the relative maps

Week 5
-> add a position estimation ability for shapes in the viewing plane
    and use this to more quickly identify the path of shapes
-> use the estimations to check if the path has been maintained by the
    object to determine if it is stationary or mobile
-> if the objects are moving, determine if the trajectory collides
    with that of the current movement the camera is experiencing
-> look into effective ways to determine absolute locations (such as
    North, South, Altitude, Vector between, etc.)
-> if feasible, create a third associative data structure that is
    sorted based off acutal location rather than relative location

Week 6
-> record more test videos and improve the ability to identify objects
    moving in the viewing plane quickly
-> read more of the openCV book and look for ways to optimize the
    ability to identify objects
-> analyze the computational complexity of the entire program in
    action and compare the the requirements for running on a mobile
    device 
-> look into the possibility of actually running the program on a mobile
    device (DROID or Iphone)
-> drink a few martinis
-> find a blind person and share the revelation

Week 7
-> research into the development of hardware for programs
-> look into robotic parts for cameras and then see if there is a way
    to get a camera with this code written to hardware attatched
-> find a suitable robotic platform to mount this piece of hardware
    too and add a simple directional navigation ability (maybe even
    random movement)
-> Contact professors at the universities that have published research
    papers that I've read and ask them what directions they think I
    should go
-> continue working on paper
-> gather data for the final program, testing in many different
    scenarios with different amounts of clutter.  Find the limitations
    in the program's ability to identify shapes and the corresponding
    graph for computational requirements to process the given amounts
    of data 

Week 8
-> throw some finishing touches on the paper that I'm writing.  Read
    and reread with professors and ask for feedback
-> write down the list of conferences that I will be sending the paper
    to and when the deadlines are and what is required
-> print paper, hand it to professors for grammar checks (other than
    the poor CS professors)
-> continue looking into hardware manufacturing for robots and find a
    suitable platform for my equipment
-> place orders for the necessary parts to build the robot
    (preferrably orders that can be filled by next week)
-> create simply python or c++ program that will move the robot
    randomly around space while recieving input from my hardware chip

Week 9
-> begin all the preparations I can for the parts that are coming in
-> write all necessary code to run the robot
-> recieve parts and build robot
-> gather more test data for my code and think of more useful charts
    for analysis
-> add the data to my final paper and continue to check for grammar
    and clarity
-> play with robot
