  note={This article talks about how to identify features in
                  an individual frame of a camera, and then match
                  relative change across the frame.  They had graphs
                  with lines of best fit for each frame and then they
                  matched lines of best fit for loop closure.  Didn't
                  see the exact process though, they have some mock
                  code in the back as well.}

  note={Haven't read the entire paper, but it has some sections that
                  are valuable for the process of monocular SLAM.
                  They talk about the points that are tracked from
                  image to image and this will be a good lead into how
                  to find those points.  That is a future direction
                  for this paper. They have a decent amount to say
                  about finding features in maps and learning
                  features before performing the mapping. These
                  feature detection algorithms sound promising.}

  title={Using Generic Image Processing Operations to Detect a
                  Calibration Grid},
  author={Wedekind, J and Penders, J and Howarth, M and Lockwood, AJ
                  and Sasada, K},
  year={2013}
  note={This paper goes through the process of detecting a calibration
                  grid.  It starts by explaining the way that they
                  find corners in an image.  Next they explain the
                  linear algebra in the corner finding algorithm and
                  how it can be shifted and translated to find corners
                  with a higher accuracy.  Then they break down the
                  new process that they are using to detect the
                  calibration grid to show that it is more reliable.
                  The last sections explaing the translation of the
                  viewed calibration grid to the camera
                  specifications.  The results are used to show that
                  they have produced a reliable algorithm for camera
                  callibration.  They do suggest future work that
                  utilizes sub-pixel accuracy.}
